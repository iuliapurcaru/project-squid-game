# project-squid-game
This app simulates a game based on the TV show Squid Game. It can randomly generate different contestants and supervisors based on lists of given names and cities. There are 4 different games in the simulation and in the end, there is only one winner. This was a project that had the goal of learning to use OOP elements.
